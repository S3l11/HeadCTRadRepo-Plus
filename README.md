# Self-Attentive Deep Fusion Framework with Transformer-Based Semantics for Emergency Head CT Reporting

This repository will host the source code for our self-attentive deep fusion framework designed for automatic radiology reporting in emergency head CT imaging. Building upon our previous work (https://github.com/S3l11/HeadCTRadRepo), this reengineered system improves contextual understanding.

# Key enhancements
- Clinically-validated preprocessing pipeline for head CT scans, optimized for both imaging and associated textual data.
- Multimodal neural architecture based on a multi-branch CNN-LSTM configuration, enhanced with fine-grained regularization to improve generalization across heterogeneous emergency datasets.
- Self-attentive module for context-aware textual representation, designed to generate radiology reports that align with established clinical standards.

Further details will be available soon.
